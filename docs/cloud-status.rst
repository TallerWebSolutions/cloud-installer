Ubuntu OpenStack Installer provides an extremely simple way to
install, deploy and scale an OpenStack cloud on top of Ubuntu server
and Juju. Deploy onto a single physical system using virtual machines
for testing, or use MAAS to deploy onto a cluster of any size.

This is the user interface for managing the deployed cloud.
